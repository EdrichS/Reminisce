This personal project was made because my girlfriend wanted to view all our previous text to reminisce on our first conversation and memorable moments. Usually, we can do this by just going to our messages app and scrolling back to prior conversations or searching up key words to go back to certain topics. The challenge with this is it takes time and sometimes it doesnt work. My girlfriend also deleted her texts from her messages because of family problems. As a solution and fun project, I developed this.
The code should run as: asks whats the phone number that you wish to read on since the very first text. Then asks for your name and the other person's name. Lastly, it outputs a TXT file that includes, name of sender, date, time, and message

This code is designed to be fully on Mac.

Dependencies: pandas

How To Use:

1. First access your Messages database on your Mac. This is usually found on the following directory: /Users/*username*/Library/Messages/chat.db

2.
