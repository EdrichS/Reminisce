# Future Improvements

For now this code only works when you have a mac AND that mac is yours and is connected to your imessages.
This code also prints the Entire history 

1. Allow to acquire the Messages Database from the user's iphone. This removes dependency on Mac devices and improves compatibility.

2. Allow to limit within a certain time frame. Example: Only print out Messages from 6/18/2025 to 9/16/2025

3. Add a function where it asks the user for their name and the other person's instead of manually editing the code

4. Add a function where it asks the user for the number of the conversation they want to reminisce on instead of manually editing the code
